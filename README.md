# Hite

## Introduction

This is a mini-vite which is used to build package.

And I will maintain the repository with monorepo(I learn and use it).

I want I can implement:

1. hite-dev-server
2. pre-bundle
3. plugin-system
4. HMR
5. CJS->ESM
6. compile source
7. parse env file
8. a cli create template project(create-hite)
9. etc
